Below is the task you need to complete.

TASK: Create a utility file for handling API calls to the Account Aggregator (AA) service. This utility should support initiating account linking requests, handling authentication/consent flows, and defining TypeScript interfaces for request and response types. Place the utility in lib/api/accountAggregator.ts. Ensure the code is compatible with the existing NEXT.js project using TypeScript. No actual partner API credentials are required (use placeholders or mock endpoints as needed for now).

IMPORTANT: Implement ONLY this specific task. Check with me for each step within the task before proceeding.

Focus on:
- The exact file/component mentioned  
- The specific functionality requested
- Clean, working implementation
- Ask questions if anything is unclear

Don't:
- Add extra features not requested
- Implement multiple tasks at once
- Create elaborate solutions
- Move to the next task automatically


If you need clarification or encounter blockers, ask specific questions.
