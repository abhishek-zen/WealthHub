Below is the task you need to complete.

TASK: Create a Shadcn Card component to display consolidated account balances on the dashboard. This component should fetch data from pages/api/accounts/balances.ts and present the total balance as well as a breakdown by account type (e.g., bank, investment, credit card). Ensure the design is visually clear, responsive, and fits the overall dashboard style. Place the component at components/dashboard/ConsolidatedBalancesCard.tsx.

IMPORTANT: Implement ONLY this specific task. Check with me for each step within the task before proceeding.

Focus on:
- The exact file/component mentioned  
- The specific functionality requested
- Clean, working implementation
- Ask questions if anything is unclear

Don't:
- Add extra features not requested
- Implement multiple tasks at once
- Create elaborate solutions
- Move to the next task automatically


If you need clarification or encounter blockers, ask specific questions.
